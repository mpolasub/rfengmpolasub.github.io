ok so all of my files have been saved to txt files because i dont want the code to conflict with anything.

here are the list of the actual file names:
app.css
create.php
delete.php
index.php
pdo.php

this site was hosted on 000webhost for free, so you wont have to worry about making payments or it disappearing.
it's pretty nice. it also works on mobile pretty well.
